<div align="center">

A very simple solution that does nothing else than it needs to. There are **_no ads, unnecessary prompts, tracking or third-party involved_**; everything is **_executed on-device_** and you never have to leave the currently opened application.

You really do not have to think about it after initial setup.

## How to use üéõÔ∏è

1. **Share a post:** Click on the relevant Share post icon in the application you're in, to bring up the ShareSheet.

2. **Share to MediaDL:** When the ShareSheet shows, scroll until you find the MediaDL option, then choose it. The first attempt requires you to grant MediaDL permissions to make requests, read through it and click Always Allow.

3. **Continue:** Just like that, MediaDL starts working and you can continue using the application. Prompts to select media might popup if you're downloading multiple items at once.

4. **Media saved:** A visual loader shows the progress and when its done, the file will have been downloaded and placed in the relevant location in your device.

MediaDL works in browsers too.

## Installation üì≤

1. The Shortcuts app comes preinstalled on Apple devices. In the case that yours is deleted, install [Shortcuts][shortcuts-app-link] from the App Store.
2. Add the [MediaDL][mediadl-shortcut-link] Shortcut to your Shortcuts library.
3. If you want to download media private to you or from a platform like Instagram, you have to install [Scriptable][scriptable-app-link] from the App Store.

   > You do not need Scriptable installed for platforms that DO NOT require sign-in.

4. Attempt to download a picture or video from a specific platform. If the platform requires you to sign in, Scriptable will open a WebView for you to sign in. Sign in and close Scriptable. Future downloads from the platform should complete from now on.

## Important Notes üóíÔ∏è

- MediaDL will **_never ask_** for your username/email or password. You will be presented with a WebView to login into the relevant official platform using their official methods.

- When using mobile data to access the internet, mobile data has to be turned on for both Shortcuts & Scriptable in your device settings for downloads to work.

- You have to be signed in to the specific platform to access media private to you.

- You may not have access to sensitive/NSFW content without being signed in to the specific platform.
