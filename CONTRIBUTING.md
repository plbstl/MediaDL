## Attach Shortcut

You can export a Siri Shortcut as a file and attach it when opening an issue or submitting a pull request.

- You need an internet connection to export a Shortcut (Apple needs to sign it on their servers).
- Open the Shortcuts app.
- Long press the Shortcut you want to export.
- Tap `Share`, tap `Options >`, and send as `File` for `Anyone`.
- Tap `Done`.
- Now you can `Save to Files`, AirDrop or share in any other way you prefer.
